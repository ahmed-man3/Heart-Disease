## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No necessary libraries to run the code except the ones available as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Heart Disease dataset to better understand:

1. Is it possible for young age people to get a heart disease ?
2. What is the most common reasons for getting heart disease?
3. What is the type of chest pain and which ones are likely to be a heart disease?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
